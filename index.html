        <h1>Paragraph:</h1>
        <p>I chose the character “Hank Ferryman” from Kushtuka for my profile since we are provided with quite a bit of information about him. Zeller describes Hank as this rich, but snobby person through his assets such as the lodge, and his mistreatment of Tapeesa (our main character). Furthermore, he seemed rich since his lodge was “massive, with vaulted ceilings and mounted animal heads everywhere” (11pg, Zeller) where everything is flown in “from Anchorage” (10pg, Zeller) a city in Alaska. The social media platform, “LinkedIn” was chosen for many reasons as he seems more middle-aged or older as stated in the text “Buck–Hank’s boy–has lost his mind” (17pg, Zeller) showing that Hank has a son, ruling out popular sites for young people such as “Instagram.” Additionally, his social status, which is that of owning a lodge and being this “rich” person, made me pick LinkedIn further as it's primarily a “business and employment social media network” (Google's description). For Hank’s location, I picked Kansas as it was hinted at at the beginning of the story, “There was an accident down at the mines. Frankie and Aqlaq and a couple of the white guys too. You know, the ones visiting from Kansas," ‘Which white guys?’ maybe one was Hank Ferryman” (4pg, Zeller). Lastly, seeing as he held a party at his lodge I would assume Hank has quite the following so I chose a slightly large following. </p>

        <p>	For post 1, I decided to pick the lodge he bought since it was an important location in the story, being one of the locations the Kushtuka visited. I picked the location Alaska for the lodge since the Kushtuka throughout the story is mainly an Alaskan mythological creature while Hank also said himself “I had everything flown in from Anchorage” (10pg, Zeller) another hint to the location being Alaska as Anchorage is an Alaskan city, additionally, the reference to” Kobuk river valley” (20pg, Zeller) finalized the location as Alaska. The image of the lodge surrounded by forest and snow also displays Alaska’s territory in the Kobuk River valley. For post 2, I decided to create a party invitation post since later on the lodge would hold lots of people for a party, there's an animal head since Tapeesa described the lodge as “massive, with vaulted ceilings and mounted animal heads everywhere.” (11pg, Zeller) This post would also get lots of likes and more comments than usual because it signifies people are showing up or are excited about the party. Lastly, post 3, would be the same inside image of the lodge with people filling it, Zeller makes the party seem lively in the story by describing the “popped cork off the champagne bottle” (13pg, Zeller) with lots of men “[showing] up and [eating], made passes at me, laughed and talked to Hank” (13pg, Zeller). This post would also have fewer likes and comments than the previous two posts as he would take the picture, and create the post during the party instead of after it since he and many people in the party would perish from the Kushtuka later on. Altogether, none of the posts have hashtags as LinkedIn posts usually never have them, with hashtags being more of a newer generation idea. </p>
